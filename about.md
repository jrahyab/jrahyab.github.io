{% include nav.html %}

I work at the intersection of **AI, entrepreneurship, and global innovation systems**.

Currently, I am part of **MIT Sloan’s Global Programs**, where I support international
leadership teams through the **MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (MIT REAP)**.
My work focuses on helping teams translate complex economic and innovation challenges into
focused, action-oriented strategies.

My background spans applied mathematics and machine learning, international development,
and program leadership. I am particularly interested in how technical understanding,
institutional design, and ecosystem coordination come together to drive sustainable,
innovation-led growth.
