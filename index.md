## About

At **MIT REAP**, I work with regions around the world to build entrepreneurial,
innovation-driven ecosystems—bringing stakeholders together and helping teams
move from strategy to coordinated execution and real impact.

My background spans applied mathematics and machine learning, international
development, and program leadership, with a focus on practical execution over
abstract frameworks.
