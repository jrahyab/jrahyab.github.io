### About

I’m the Assistant Director at MIT Sloan’s Global Programs, working with the MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (MIT REAP). I help regions around the world to build innovation-driven entreprenuerial ecosystems--taking messy, complex economic challenges and turn them into clear, innovation-led growth strategies.

My background is in entrepreneurship, applied mathematics and machine learning, international development, and program leadership. I am focused on how technical understanding, institutional design, and ecosystem coordination come together to drive sustainable, innovation-driven growth.
