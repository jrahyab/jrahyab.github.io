## MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (MIT REAP)

At MIT REAP, I support teams from around the world in designing and executing
**innovation-driven growth strategies**.

- Program design and execution for global, multi-stakeholder teams  
- Faculty coordination and engagement with regional innovation ecosystems  
- Strategy, governance, and action-phase implementation within complex institutional settings

## AI & Technical Work

My technical work is grounded in a **first-principles approach** to understanding modern
machine learning systems, with an emphasis on clarity, foundations, and real-world applicability.

Areas of focus include:

- Building transformer architectures from scratch (NumPy-based implementations)  
- Attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and training dynamics  
- Applied statistics and machine learning foundations  

I’m particularly interested in how deep technical understanding can inform
**organizational AI strategy and adoption**.

## Innovation Ecosystems & Global Programs

I work at the intersection of entrepreneurship, policy, and institutions, with a focus on
how innovation ecosystems function across different economic and regional contexts.

This includes:

- Mapping and engaging the Boston & Cambridge innovation ecosystem  
- Supporting global entrepreneurship and innovation programs  
- Institutional design, policy engagement, and ecosystem coordination  

My work spans both emerging and advanced economies, with an emphasis on
**practical execution over abstract frameworks**.
