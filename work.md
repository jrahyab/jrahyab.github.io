## MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (MIT REAP)

At MIT REAP, I support regions across emerging and advanced economies in designing
and executing **innovation-driven entrepreneurial ecosystems**.

My work focuses on ecosystem-level execution, including:

- Ecosystem design for entrepreneurial and innovation-driven regional development  
- Program design and delivery for global, multi-stakeholder leadership teams  
- Stakeholder alignment across government, industry, academia, and entrepreneurs  
- Strategy, governance, and action-phase implementation in complex institutional settings
