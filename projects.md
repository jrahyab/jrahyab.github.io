## Selected Technical Projects

My technical work follows a **first-principles approach**, focused on understanding modern machine learning systems from the ground up and connecting technical depth to real-world use.

### Transformer Models from Scratch
- Implemented core transformer architecture using NumPy  
- Focus on attention, positional encoding, and training dynamics  
- No high-level ML libraries  

### MNIST Digit Recognition from Scratch
- End-to-end implementation without external ML frameworks  
- Emphasis on fundamentals and learning dynamics  

### Applied Machine Learning Projects
- Regression, classification, and evaluation using real-world datasets  
- Focus on interpretability and practical modeling choices  

I’m particularly interested in how deep technical understanding can inform **organizational AI strategy and adoption**.
