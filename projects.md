### Machine Learning Systems (from scratch & applied)

- **Transformer models (from scratch)**  
  Implemented core transformer architecture using NumPy, with a focus on attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and training dynamics — no high-level ML libraries.

- **MNIST digit recognition (from scratch)**  
  End-to-end implementation without external ML frameworks, emphasizing learning dynamics and fundamental model behavior.

- **Applied machine learning projects**  
  Regression, classification, and evaluation on real-world datasets, with an emphasis on interpretability and practical modeling choices.
